    });
    currentPlayer.status = PlayerStatus.bankrupt;

    const remainingPlayers = nextGame.players.filter((p) => p.status === PlayerStatus.playing);
    if (remainingPlayers.length === 1) {
      newUiUpdates.push({
        playerId: remainingPlayers[0].id,
        promptType: PromptType.playerWin,
        type: PromptType.playerWin,
        uiUpdateType: UiUpdateType.prompt,
