- Move notifications to logic functions (e.g. move player)
- Pay fine to get out of jail

- Implement get out of jail card actions

- Paying actions should only be applied if the player has enough money
- Up on every action triggered, evaluate the current player status
  if (currentPlayer.money < 0) {
    changeHistory.unshift({
      playerId: currentPlayer.id,
      type: PromptType.bankruptcy,
    });
    currentPlayer.status = PlayerStatus.bankrupt;

    const remainingPlayers = nextGame.players.filter((p) => p.status === PlayerStatus.playing);
    if (remainingPlayers.length === 1) {
      newUiUpdates.push({
        playerId: remainingPlayers[0].id,
        promptType: PromptType.playerWin,
        type: PromptType.playerWin,
        uiUpdateType: UiUpdateType.prompt,
      });
    }
  }
